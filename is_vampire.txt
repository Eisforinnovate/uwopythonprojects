I worked with Michael after his submitted his, and his was much better than mine. He used a series of if statements, testing between 3 different results in the row array. His was much better than mine because it was a lot cleaner and simpler. He tested between the three results to see if the probability was "<=" to the number assigned. If it passed the rest, it would assign the probability equal to results a and/or result b,  and then return it. What I did wrong was I tried to do all of these tests and returns in one large if statement, which got very messy. Mike however showed me a different was. If it failed the test, then it would just move onto the next test to see if it would return that probability. This is a much better approach then my hair pulling one. The "is_vampire(row)" function takes a 1-D array (row) of 6 measurements and returns a probability that the person with these measures is a vampire. By doing it in a series of if statements, comparing to see if each if passed, the probability of being a vampire based on those measurements are returned.
